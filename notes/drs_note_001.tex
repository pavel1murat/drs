  \begin{abstract}
    Using 4.8\invfb\ of data collected by the CDF experiment in \ppbar\ collisions 
    at 1.96 TeV we study production of events with two Z bosons. 

    We analyse Z($l^+l^-$)Z($l^+l^-$), Z($l^+l^-$)Z($\nu\nu$) and Z($l^+l^-$)Z(jj) 
    final states in search for narrow resonances.

    Analysis of the Z($l^+l^-$)Z($l^+l^-$) channel uses data reconstructed with GEN7.
    Z($l^+l^-$)Z($\nu\nu$) and Z($l^+l^-$)Z(jj) channels are analysed using GEN6 data.

    Production cross section of the ZZ pairs measured in the region $M_{ZZ}<300$ GeV 
    is consistent with the SM expectations.
